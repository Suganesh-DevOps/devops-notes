Above is the flow ^
------Recursive Resolver -----
Takes a query from a client and does all the work to return the final IP.

What is Stub Resolver ?
It is A lightweight resolver in your OS or browser that just forwards requests to a recursive resolver.

What is root DNS server ?
oot DNS servers (e.g., .). example
.com
.net
.in

what is TLD name server?
 it will be having authoritative name server

what is  Authoritative DNS Server ?
Authoritative DNS Server is the final source of truth that holds the actual DNS records for a domain name.

- Our browser -> Stub resolver

There are 2 types of DNS, 
1. Private DNS resolver --> Google, Cloud fare
2. Public resolver --> corporate DNS

--Caching---
caching in DNS!
Why caching is taking place in DNS ?
  --> Faster Domain Resolution
  --> AVoid network traffic
  --> Reducing load to DNS server
  --> Fewer points of faikure
  --> avoid latency
  ---> TTL  Flexibility for Admins

What is the disadvantages of caching ?
   --> If  DNS has been changed to different IP we may have to revisit again 
   --> if the cache has expired client will use oudated entries

----Levels of caching----
1. Browser level caching
where it stored --> tored in-memory within the browser's DNS subsystem.

2. OS level caching which Stub resolver
Windows: Stored in DNS Client Service memory.
Linux/macOS: Stored in memory by system resolver.

3.Recursive resolver
In-memory on the DNS server (like Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS).

How to view the OS cache
In Linux:
systemd-resolve --statistics
in windows:
ipconfig /displaydns
