
Before getting into know other stuff please understand the very basics
1. What is Network ?
A network is a group of two or more connected devices (like computers, servers, phones, printers) 
 simply --> A network connects devices locally, for example 
2. What is Internet ?
The Internet is a global network of computers that are connected together to communicate, share information, and access services.
 simply --> the Internet connects millions of networks globally.
--IP--
IP --> Internet protocal address
Types of IP address
   1. IPV4
   2. IPV6

 IPV4
   it is a 32 bit numeric address and separted by dot
   176.8.122.2 --> each numer is a byte tottaly 4 bytes.
              Why it is only 4 bytes ?
              It is because of IPV4 protocal when they designed
  

--Subnet--
Dividing larger newwork into  smaller part
   What is the use ?
     1. security
     2. privacy
     3. To reduce IP address waste

     Every IP address has 
         1. newwork part (To identify to which network it is belongs to)
         2. Host part (to identify the Host)
    Subnet adds more bits on network part --> which means {{172.62}.2}.8 -->  {{172.62}.2} this is network part --> .8 for host part
     so that we can create a range of servers as per of need.
     This all can be done using (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) --> CIDR
     172.33.2.0/24 --> 256 serers
     172.33.2.0/30 --> 4 servers
     and so on..
