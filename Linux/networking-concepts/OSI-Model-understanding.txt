The purpose of the OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection model) is to provide a standardized framework for understanding and designing how different 
networking protocols interact in a network communication system. It divides the communication process into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions, 
to help developers and network engineers:

Application layer
my request

Presentation Layer
It will translate the data to understandable formet (json, XML)

Session
It will establish
 manages
 terminates the connection between Applications

Transport layer
It ensures reliability of data transmission via segmentation,
sequencing
acknowledgements

networking
look for the best way to route our packets,
add IP addressing

Data link
it will make sure the data transmission between two connected device between the same network using MAC address

physical
t includes the physical hardware (cables, switches, electrical signals) that transmits raw bits.‚Äù
