What I understood in OSI model is
1. when I hit www.google.com in browser the request will be sent as a http/s protocal in "Application Layer"
2. The request that I made in my browser will me manipulated and encrypted format that the Application server can understand as well as get rid of hackers - "Presentation layer"
3. Once data is segmented browser Application will establish a session to communicate with Application server - Session layer
4. It retrives the data from session layer and it will break into a segment and add port to route a particular server -> transport layer
5. it will find the correct way to send the request across network --> network layer
6. It will make sure data is sent to a correct device
7. physical cables, wi-fi signals

Application layer
my request

Presentation Layer
data encryption, data formating so that network server will understand the request

Session layer
establish a connection to communicate with Application server

transport layer
it will act as error detection , it will take care of complete data transmission, it will segment the data into smaller part along with it will add the port to where the request gonna being sent.

network layer
it will look for the best way to sent the data for example
from our browser to our wifi router

data link
it will be the MAC device for example from our wifi to other devoce within the same network

physical layers
cables, signals and so on
